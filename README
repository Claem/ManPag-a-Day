A simple program designed to pick a random help topic and post it to your wordpress automatically.  Requires some 
initial set-up with Wordpress & crontab; Works seamlessly and automatically afterwards. I reccommend running listgen during 
first-time set-up so you get helpfiles tailored to what's on your system.

To install:
1.Install the xmlrpc library:
  pip install python-wordpress-xmlrpc
2. Create new directory:
  mkdir ManPag-a-Day
3. Clone this repo into it:
  git clone 'URL'
4. Run listgen to create your own index of helpfiles: 
  ./listgen > filelist
5. Run shuffler:
  ./shuffler
6. Create a file where you'll store your credentials:
  vim authorization
  (You have to create this on yourself b/c we have git ignoring this file.)
