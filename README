A simple program designed to pick a random help topic and post it to your wordpress automatically.  Requires some 
initial set-up with Wordpress & crontab; Works seamlessly and automatically afterwards. I reccommend running listgen during 
first-time set-up so you get helpfiles tailored to what's on your system.

To install:
1. Create new directory:
  mkdir ManPag-a-Day
2. Clone this repo into it:
  git clone 'URL'
3. Run listgen to create your index of helpfiles 
  ./listgen > filelist
4. Run shuffler:
  ./shuffler
