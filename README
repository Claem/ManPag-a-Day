A simple program designed to pick a random help topic and post it to your wordpress automatically.  Requires some 
initial set-up with Wordpress & crontab; Works seamlessly and automatically afterwards. I reccommend running listgen during 
first-time set-up so you get helpfiles tailored to what's on your system.

To install:
1.Install the xmlrpc library:
  pip install python-wordpress-xmlrpc
2. Create new directory:
  mkdir ManPag-a-Day
3.Clone this repo into it:
  git clone 'URL'
4.Update your verification info in authorization file.
5.Run listgen to create your own index of helpfiles: 
  ./listgen > filelist
6.Run shuffler:
  ./shuffler

Program can be run manually or by giving the task to crontab. 
  ./manpage
